## Introduction

This is a project for the Emerging Technologies module for 2021. The task is to prove the understanding of Jupyter Lab, Python and to show our learning outcomes of the the Emerging Technologies module. We are required to have two Jupyter Notebooks, one called scikit-learn and the other quantum-deutsch.

<br>

## Contents of the Notebooks

### Scikit-Learn Notebook
- This notebook contains the overall overview of the Scikit-Learn Python Library.
- Demonstration of three algorithms where some were covered in class and some were researched for.
- Visuals and plots.

<br>

### Quantum-Deutsch Notebook
- Quantum-Deutsch notebook contains the description of Quantum Computing.
- Comparison of Quantum Computing and Classical Computing.
- Descriptions of the Deutsch's Algorithm and code samples.

## How to Run this Project on Docker

To open this repository on Docker with Jupyter Lab:
1. Clone this repository by copying this *[URL](https://github.com/Oskar-Ciebien/Emerging-Technologies-Project)*.
2. Open the cloned folder of this repository.
3. Run docker desktop on your PC.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal on the cloned folder.
5. Run this command **docker-compose up** in the command prompt or terminal.
6. After docker has loaded up, copy the last localhost **(127.0. 0.1)** URL which contains the **token** and open it in a browser of your choice.
7. Jupyter Lab will open. Feel free to open any of the notebooks from the panel on the left.
