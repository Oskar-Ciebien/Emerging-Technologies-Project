## Introduction

This is a project for the Emerging Technologies module for 2021. The task is to prove the understanding of Jupyter Lab, Python and to show our learning outcomes of the the Emerging Technologies module. We are required to have two Jupyter Notebooks, one called scikit-learn and the other quantum-deutsch.

<br>

## Contents of the Notebooks

### Scikit-Learn Notebook
- This notebook contains the overall overview of the Scikit-Learn Python Library.
- Demonstration of three algorithms where some were covered in class and some were researched for.
- Visuals and plots.

<br>

### Quantum-Deutsch Notebook
- Quantum-Deutsch notebook contains the description of Quantum Computing.
- Comparison of Quantum Computing and Classical Computing.
- Descriptions of the Deutsch's Algorithm and code samples.

## How to Run Jupyter Notebook

In order to open the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you are required to:
1. Clone this repository by copying this *[URL](https://github.com/Oskar-Ciebien/Emerging-Technologies-Project)*.
2. Open the cloned folder with the contents of this repository.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal on the folder.
4. Run jupyter lab by running the following command **jupyter lab**.
5. Double click on any of the notebooks from the left panel in Jupyter Lab.

<br>

## How to Run this Project on Docker

To open this repository on Docker with Jupyter Lab:
1. Clone this repository by copying this *[URL](https://github.com/Oskar-Ciebien/Emerging-Technologies-Project)*.
2. Open the cloned folder of this repository.
3. Run docker desktop on your PC.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal on the cloned folder.
5. Run this command **docker-compose up** in the command prompt or terminal.
6. After docker has loaded up, copy the last localhost **(127.0. 0.1)** URL which contains the **token** and open it in a browser of your choice.
7. Jupyter Lab will open. Feel free to open any of the notebooks from the panel on the left.

## Credits

### nbViewer
I used nbViewer to display my notebooks in a static form.
- https://nbviewer.org/
- https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/714 (Badge)

### Binder
Binder allowed me to display my notebooks in dynamic form.
- https://mybinder.org/

### Scikit-Learn
Scikit-Learn is one of the requirements for this project. I heavily relied on this machine learning library.
- https://scikit-learn.org/

### NumPy

- https://numpy.org/

### Jupyter
I relied on Jupyter to create my notebooks.
- https://jupyter.org/

### Qiskit
Qiskit plays an important role in this project. I used it in my **Quantum-Deutsch Notebook**. As it is a great tool to use when working with Quantum.
- https://qiskit.org/

### Docker
I relied on Docker in order to make the notebooks easily available. Docker is fairly popular among the software community. Thanks to Docker we can use software without downloading dependencies onto our machines.

### Pandas
I used Pandas for data manipulation in my **Scikit-Learn Notebook**.
- https://pandas.pydata.org/

### Machine Learning Repository
I used the Machine Learning Repository to find all of my Data Sets.
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

### Kaggle
I relied on Kaggle to look for tutorials on many different topics for this project. It is a great source of tutorials and information.
- https://www.kaggle.com/

### Module Content
I heavily relied on the module content that was published throughout the semester.
- Dr. Ian McLoughlin at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology
