**Student Name:** Oskar Ciebien

## Introduction
This is a project for the Emerging Technologies module for 2021. The task is to prove the understanding of Jupyter Lab and Python. We are required to have two Jupyter Notebooks, one called scikit-learn and the othe quantum-deutsch. Where in scikit-learn we need to provide three scikit-learn algorithms. In quantum-deutsch notebook, we need to compare quantum computing and classical computing, and explain Deutsch's algorithm with the code simulating it with qiskit.
